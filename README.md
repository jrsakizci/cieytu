# Hello!
- First of all, you should know about "Atomic Design Principles". After that it'll be very easy to understand this structure. But i think its semantic if you even know a little bit of chemistry then it'll be very easy to understand.

- Also this isn't a boilerplate, i create from scratch this for especially this homework.

- I kept styles apart under the assets folder. I created for atom groups or atoms 1, for pages 1.

- So i could design atoms depends on the page im on.

- I thought if "organisms" are living things, so i could create a container there and transform information to molecules - atoms from there. So its how it works right now.

- Redux Dev Tools also installed, so you can see actions on devtools.
